Communication is done through [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/UKHJMQs74u). Come by and say hi! Otherwise, feel free to browse our issues list for contribution ideas.

Never contributed to open source before? All levels of experience are welcome! We're happy to help mentor you even if this is your first open source contribution. You must, however, have knowledge about what IRL streaming is and at least watch a few IRL streamers to understand the use case for a chat app like this. Stop by the Discord and ask for muxfd.
